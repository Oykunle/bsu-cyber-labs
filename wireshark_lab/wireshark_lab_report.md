# Wireshark Mini Lab – Week 2

## 1. DNS Analysis
- Domain queried: wise-m.public.cdn.office.net
- Response IP: (write the IP you saw in the DNS response)
- Description: Captured DNS traffic showing query and response for a Microsoft CDN.

## 2. TCP Stream Analysis
- Connection: 10.0.0.244 → 162.159.135.234 (Cloudflare)
- Protocol: TCP / TLSv1.2 (port 443)
- Observation: This shows the three-way handshake followed by encrypted HTTPS traffic.

## 3. Summary
This exercise helped me understand how DNS resolves domain names and how TCP establishes secure connections for HTTPS traffic.
