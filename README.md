# BSU_Cyber_Labs

This repository contains my Python and Cybersecurity practice labs for Ball State University. It tracks my learning progress in Python programming, Git/GitHub workflow, and foundational cybersecurity concepts.

## About Me
Hello! I'm **Oyekunle Nestor Alabi**, a Computer Science student with a concentration in Cybersecurity & Secure Software Design at Ball State University. This repository showcases my hands-on practice labs and small projects.

## Labs / Scripts

### Week 1
- **hello_cyber.py** ‚Üí My first interactive Python script: greeting user.
- **basics_lab.py** ‚Üí Python basics: variables, lists, loops, and functions.
- **interactive_tools.py** ‚Üí Interactive lab: asks user for name & favorite tool, updates tool list.

### Week 2
- **age_check.py** ‚Üí Validates user age and checks Cyber Lab access.
- **multi_user.py** ‚Üí Multi-user interactive program: add favorite cybersecurity tools.
- **favorite_tool.py** ‚Üí Mini challenge: function to print a favorite cybersecurity tool.
- **favorite_tool_interactive.py** ‚Üí Mini challenge: interactive loop with functions to add multiple tools.

## Week 2: Wireshark Mini Lab

This lab focuses on **network traffic analysis** using **Wireshark**.  
I captured and analyzed packets while visiting safe websites to understand how DNS and TCP work in real-world communication.

### üîç Tasks Performed
1. Captured 30‚Äì60 seconds of network traffic while visiting safe websites.  
2. Applied a **DNS filter** to observe domain queries and IP responses.  
3. Applied a **TCP filter** and followed a **TCP stream** to analyze a connection.  
4. Saved screenshots and explained the findings.

### üìÇ Files Included
- `wireshark_lab_report.md` ‚Üí Step-by-step report and observations.  
- `dns_filter.png` ‚Üí Screenshot showing DNS query and response.  
- `tcp_stream.png` ‚Üí Screenshot showing TCP stream details.

### üß† Skills Learned
- Basic network traffic capture with Wireshark  
- Filtering and analyzing DNS and TCP packets  
- Understanding HTTPS encryption and TCP handshake  

## Tools / Skills Practiced
- Python (input, variables, lists, loops, functions)
- Python input validation (try/except)
- List management (add/remove items)
- Git / GitHub workflow
- Basic interactive programming for Cybersecurity applications
