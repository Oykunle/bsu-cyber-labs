# BSU_Cyber_Labs

This repository contains my Python and Cybersecurity practice labs for Ball State University. It tracks my learning progress in Python programming, Git/GitHub workflow, and foundational cybersecurity concepts.

## About Me
Hello! I'm **Oyekunle Nestor Alabi**, a Computer Science student with a concentration in Cybersecurity & Secure Software Design at Ball State University. This repository showcases my hands-on practice labs and small projects.

## Labs / Scripts

### Week 1
- **hello_cyber.py** → First interactive Python script: greets the user.
- **basics_lab.py** → Python basics: variables, lists, loops, and functions.
- **interactive_tools.py** → Interactive lab: asks user for name & favorite cybersecurity tool, updates tool list.

### Week 2
- **age_check.py** → Age validation script with access control to Cyber Lab.
- **multi_user.py** → Multi-user interactive Cyber Lab program: add/remove tools with input validation.

## Tools / Skills Practiced
- Python (input, variables, lists, loops, functions)
- Python input validation (try/except)
- List management (add/remove items)
- Git / GitHub workflow
- Basic interactive programming for Cybersecurity applications
